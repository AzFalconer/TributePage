    <p>Maurice Ralph Hilleman (August 30, 1919 - April 11, 2005) was an American microbiologist who specialized in vaccinology and developed over 36 vaccines, more than any other scientist. Of the 14 vaccines routinely recommended in current vaccine schedules,
      he developed eight: those for measles, mumps, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, chickenpox, meningitis, pneumonia and Haemophilus influenzae bacteria.</p>
    <p>
      Hilleman was also the first to identify how the influenza virus mutates, and he virtually single-handedly spearheaded creation of the vaccine that prevented the Asian flu outbreak of 1957 from becoming a repeat of the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, which
      killed 20 million people worldwide.</p>
    <p>He also created the world's first licensed vaccine against a viral cancer, which blocked Marek's disease, a lymphoma of chickens. The development revolutionized the poultry industry.</p>
    <p>
      In 1988 President Ronald Reagan presented him with the National Medal of Science, the nation's highest scientific honor. He received the Prince Mahidol Award from the King of Thailand for the advancement of public health, as well as a special lifetime
      achievement award from the World Health Organization.</p>
